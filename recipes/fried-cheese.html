    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In the heart of Czech culinary tradition lies a dish so comforting and universally loved that you’ll find it served from the bustling streets of Prague to the cozy nooks of family kitchens: Czech Fried Cheese, or Smažený Sýr. This dish, affectionately known as “smažák” by locals, is a testament to the simple joy of cheese, transformed into a golden, crispy delight that’s hard to resist.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of hard cheese (Gouda, Edam, Monterey Jack, Mozzarella, Swiss Gruyère), about 1/3-1/2-inch thick</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour (43 g)</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (120 g)</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparing</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by heating a generous amount of oil in a pan.</li>
        <li>Prepare the eggs by beating them lightly with a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Ready the cheese slices by first coating them in flour, then dipping them in the beaten eggs, and finally covering them in breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Fry the cheese slices over medium heat, about 3-4 minutes on each side, until each piece is a perfect golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your choice of potato side and a dollop of tartar sauce for the full experience.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Serving</h2>
    <p>I know that together with French fries, this might sound like too much fried stuff on one plate, but they go surprisingly well together! And if you really must have something more fresh, let’s  do it with a traditional Czech potato salad.</p>
